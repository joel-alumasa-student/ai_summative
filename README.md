## AI Summative

### Stroke Prediction 

This is an AI-based stroke prediction system that can accurately predict the risk of stroke in individual patients.
Advances in technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), have enabled the development of predictive models that can identify individuals at high risk of stroke. 
In this project, we aim to develop an AI-based stroke prediction system that can accurately predict the risk of stroke in patients. 
The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and generate a personalized risk score for each patient. 
The motivation behind this project is to provide healthcare providers and patients with a tool that can enable early detection and prevention of stroke, 
thereby reducing the incidence of stroke and its associated morbidity and mortality.
